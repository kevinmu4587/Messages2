You two were incredibly close when you were kids – in fact, people oftentimes thought of you as siblings. When you were 11, she left for an art school across the city, resulting in you two losing contact. Having reunited in the same high school, she seems to enjoy being with you and deeply treasures her childhood memories with you. %npc2name is very shy – even getting embarrassed others thank her. She loves cats, art, and hugs. She’s also known to be quite spontaneous."
