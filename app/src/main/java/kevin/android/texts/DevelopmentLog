    - Room architecture works (DAO, Repository, Database w/ prepopulating)
[Wednesday, August 18th, 2021]
    - MainActivity observes LiveData for sentMessages and upcomingMessages
    - working recycler view with two ViewHolder types: NPCMessage and MyMessage
    - started working on PlayThread
        - NPC messages are loaded immediately
        - My messages are loaded in after button click on sendButton
        - no more messages are loaded by the end of the group

    - ConversationFragment now successfully navigates to ChatFragment and sends a Conversation object
[Friday, August 20st, 2021]
    - MessageDatabase is now pre-populated using JSON asset
    - conversations now select the appropriate messages
[Sunday, August 22nd, 2021]
    - replaced PlayThread with PlayRunnable
        - fixed issue with the Runnable -- thought there was a problem with database pre-populating, but
          it was due to many PlayThreads being instantiated
[Monday, August 23rd, 2021]
    - Conversation can now be sent back from ChatFragment to ConversationFragment
    - corresponding Conversation object now updated in the ConversationDatabase
[Tuesday, August 24th, 2021]
    - fixed issue where different conversations loaded the same messages of player 1
    - fixed issue where messages of player 2 would not render to the screen
    - fixed Runnable timing issues (messages would sometimes load in at the wrong time)
[Wednesday, August 25th, 2021]
    - conversation can now update the last message live using SharedViewModel
    - last message is bolded if it belongs to an npc
[Thursday, August 26th, 2021]
    - tried these, but ended up removing them:
        - changed all "state" to "conversation.getChatState()" in ChatFragment, but this caused an issue where
          if the chat was left on "choose," the PlayRunnable would never assign the next message
        - made the SharedViewModel store the only instance of the conversation in chat, but updating fields
          of an object does not count as an update to LiveData
    - implemented groups
    - removed sending conversation object back to ConversationFragment and the observer of the lastMessage field
        - ConversationFragment now only observes the active conversation object
        - this observer updates the group number and the last message
[Saturday, August 27th, 2021]
    - tried to fix the issue of when to create new Threads, without success
    - the plan is now to freeze the thread every time the fragment is closed
    - Thread now freezes whenever the Fragment is closed
    - a new one is created whenever the fragment opens
TODO
    - figure out how blocks may work
    - load the conversation json
